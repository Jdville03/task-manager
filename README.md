# check! - Task Manager

Use this Rails app to track and manage your checklists and tasks. You can share lists with other registered users to collaborate as a group to track the assignment and completion of tasks.

## Usage

Visit the app at https://check-task-manager.herokuapp.com/. Sign up or sign in with your Facebook account to get started. Create lists and tasks. Check your completed tasks. You can also prioritize a task with a star, assign it to a user for shared lists, set a due date, and add a note. Navigate the site to view all your tasks by categories or by list. Customize views by sorting lists and tasks and hiding completed tasks. You can also edit/delete lists and tasks and manage users for a shared list.
